Muyo - not so useless library
====
It's a PHP 5.3 utility library that some of us are using in our work.

Some of the key-points we are trying achieve are:
* Unification and filling gaps in standard PHP function set
* We admire functional-way of solving problems
* We build our API using well-known nomenclature from different languages
* We're trying to be as decoupled as it's possible ( you should be able to include just a single module and it should still work )
* No mandatory external dependencies (we're trying to gracefully degrade, or make move depending-parts to separate modules)
* We're loving defaults-based configuration ( unspecified things always fallback to defaults leaving you a fully-working system ). Still, we're trying to be as customizable as possible.

Warning: it's very bleeding-edge and has no versioning yet! If you like it, use it, but you should inspect changes before every update.
